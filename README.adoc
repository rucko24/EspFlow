This project is inspired by the https://github.com/marcelstoer/nodemcu-pyflasher[nodemcu-pyflasher^]

The UI is based on Vaadin Flow and allows invoking `esptool.py` to execute operations common to microcontrollers of the esp32, and esp8266 family.

== Some operations that are possible, under development âš’

== Flash View

- `flash_id` with this command we read basic information from the microcontroller.

== Read firmware View

- `read_flash` Backup of the microcontroller firmware with, with the possibility to set the memory sections to be read, custom initial and final read size, or `ALL` for full read.

```sh
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB1 --baud 11500 read_flash 0 ALL /tmp/esp-backup-flash-dir/ESP8266EX-1720865320370-backup.bin
```

== *New features*, will be coming soon

== Running the application

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to import Vaadin projects to different 
IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/guide/step-by-step/importing) (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, and VS Code).

== *Environment* variables must be set to login with the esptool user

These environment variables can also be set in the `IDE` for convenience.

- `*ADMIN_ESPFLOW_USER*`
- `*ESPFLOW_PASSWORD*`

== Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using 

```sh
java -jar target/espflow-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --ADMIN_ESPFLOW_USER=xxxx --ESPFLOW_PASSWORD=xxxx
```

== Project structure

- `MainLayout.java` in `src/main/java` contains the navigation setup (i.e., the
  side/top bar and the main menu). This setup uses
  [App Layout](https://vaadin.com/components/vaadin-app-layout).
- `views` package in `src/main/java` contains the server-side Java views of your application.
- `views` folder in `frontend/` contains the client-side JavaScript views of your application.
- `themes` folder in `frontend/` contains the custom CSS styles.
